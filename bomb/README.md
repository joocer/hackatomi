# The Bomb

The bomb is a prop with a Micro:bit used as the display panel.

When not being interacted with, the bomb is in count-down mode. In this it starts with all of the LEDs on, and flashes them all on once every three seconds. At the start, the because most of the LEDs will be on, the difference will be minimal, but as the time approaches 0, the difference will become more pronounced.
